# Level 8

A picture of a [bee](/8/integrity.jpg) is provided. The image file is named `integrity`. 


The HTML title is `working hard?` probably refers to the bee in the image, since bees work hard. 


Right below the image of the bee it says `Where is the missing link?`.


When clicking on the picture it prompts a user and password, to get to level9 we probably need to get the username and password.


To gather more information on the level I checked the page source. In the page source there's an HTML comment that looks like this.


```

If you've had prior experience with `bzip` files you probably can tell right away it's a bzip file signature. 


For those who've never seen or used a **[bzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2)** file before it's like a zip file used in *nix systems.


Every file has a file format a special signature telling this is a certain file `bzip` files use **[BZh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2#File_format)** as the file header.


Python provides a built-in **[bz2](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html)** module for bzip compression and decompression. 


You can use **[bz2.decompress](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bz2.html#bz2.decompress)** to decompress bzip2 compressed data.


`bz2.decompress` requires bytes strings as an argument. It needs a `byte-string` as an argument because data compression and decompression work on binary data.


Decompressing `un` and `pw` gives me `2` byte-strings. `huge`, `file` respectively.


```python
b'huge' b'file'
```

Entering **huge** as the username and **file** as the password takes you to level9. It's the level that required user authentication.


You can send the credentials in the standard HTTP Authorization header like this `http://www.huge:file@pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/good.html`


To be honest I don't know how bzip compresses data. If you're interested reading [this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Bzip2-process-How-is-it-performed) will be a nice start, for further information on bzip2 you should probably read articles or books by professionals that work on data compression. 


Explaining complex compression methods like bzip2 is beyond the knowledge of my scope.
