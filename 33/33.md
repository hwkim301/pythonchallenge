# Level33


**[beer1.jpg](beer1.jpg)** A picture of a Jack Daniel's beer stand is given.

The HTML title is `33 bottles of beer on the wall`.

Well we're on level33 so that's why there's probably `33` bottles of beer.

I thought Jack Daniel's only produced whisky but maybe I was wrong. 

The page source also had this as comments. 


```HTML 
<!--
If you are blinded by the light,
remove its power, with its might.
Then from the ashes, fair and square,
another truth at you will glare.
-->
```

Not really sure what it means, but I guess we have to manipulate the brightness of the image. 


Since the tite of the image is `beer1.jpg` let's check out **[beer2.jpg](beer2.jpg)** as well.


It tells us it's a png file.


Here's what **[beer2.jpg](beer2.png)** looks like. 


There doesn't seem to be any important comments in the page source for `beer2.jpg`.


From now on we'll have to use PIL to inspect the image.


```python
from PIL import Image 

img = Image.open("beer2.png")
print(img.mode)  # L
print(img.size)  # (138,138)
```

`beer2.jpg` is a square image that has a width and height of `138`.

It's also a luminous image(#L), basically it's black and white. 

For luminous images the pixel values range from `0~255`.


There's a nice detailed explanation **[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52307290/what-is-the-difference-between-images-in-p-and-l-mode-in-pil)**


on what the `'L'` mode in PIL means. 

Feel free to read **[this](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#modes)** as well. 


Now that we checked out what `beer2.jpg` looks like, let's try mangling the pixels in the image. 

PIL's getdata returns an object containing pixel values. 

To convert it to a normal sequence you need to use list.


```python
img.getdata()
<ImagingCore at 0x78a0ddf4ac50>
```

```python
pixels = list(img.getdata())
[1, 43, 7, 13, 7, 1, 1, 85, 25, 85, 25, 1, 91, 103, 31, 37, 1, 13, 169, 1, 37, 13, 193, 13, 1, 193,...]
```


Changing the URL to **[gremlins](www.kohsamui:thailand@pythonchallenge.com/pc/rock/gremlins.html)** takes you to the end.


You've now completed the pythonchallenge.

I could find only 2 people who solved each and every problem from pythonchallenge.

They both seem be Chinese, what a coincidence. 

That's probably why a lot of skilled programmers are Chinese lol.
