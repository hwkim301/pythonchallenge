# Level33


**[beer1.jpg](/pythonchallenge/33/beer1.jpg)** A picture of a Jack Daniel's beer stand is given.

The HTML title is `33 bottles of beer on the wall`.

Well we're on level33 so that's why there's probably `33` bottles of beer.

```

Not really sure what it means, but I guess we have to manipulate the brightness of the image. 


Since the tite of the image is `beer1.jpg` let's check out **[beer2.jpg](/pythonchallenge/33/beer2.jpg)** as well.


It tells us it's a png file.


Here's what **[beer2.jpg](/pythonchallenge/33/beer2.png)** looks like. 


There doesn't seem to be any important comments in the page source for `beer2.jpg`.


From now on we'll have to use PIL to inspect the image.


```python
from PIL import Image 

img = Image.open("beer2.png")
print(img.mode)  # L
print(img.size)  # (138,138)
```

`beer2.jpg` is a square image that has a width and height of `138`.

It's also an 


Changing the URL to **[gremlins](www.kohsamui:thailand@pythonchallenge.com/pc/rock/gremlins.html)** takes you to the end.


You've now completed the pythonchallenge.
