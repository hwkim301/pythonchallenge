My personal solutions to the Python Challenge problems. 

I am going to write the explanations as detailed as possible. 

Inspired by [hackingnote](https://www.hackingnote.com/en/python-challenge-solutions/) and [david.webook](https://david.webook.club/tag/the-python-challenge/)

Those people wrote nice Pytonic code.
