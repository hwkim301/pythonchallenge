# Level30


**[yankeedoodle.jpg](/30/yankeedoodle.jpg)** a picture of a beach is given. 

The title of the web page is `relax you are on 30`.


I found some comments in the page source .


```html
The picture is only meant to help you relax
<!-- while you look at the csv file -->
```


So it looks like a csv file is here.


By changing the url to **[yankeedoodle.csv](http://www.repeat:switch@pythonchallenge.com/pc/ring/yankeedoodle.csv)** you can download a csv file. 


The csv file contains just a whole bunch of decimals.

I was stuck here so I had to get some hints online.


The comments in the page source was this.

Let's open the csv file and check the file as if it were an image. 

There are a total of `7367` decimals in the csv file. 

`7367` is a factor of `53` and `139`. 

We need to flip the image 90 degrees clockwise.

However PIL Image.ROTATE rotates counter clockwise so to flip the image 90 degrees we need to flip in 270 counter clockwise.


I don't know why they designed it this way, but according to Copilot PIL uses counterclockwise rotation because that's the standard mathematical convention for rotating Images. 


Here's what it says.

this is the standard mathematical convention for rotation in image processing and computer graphics.

In mathematics, positive angles are measured counterclockwise from the x-axis, and many image libraries follow this convention for consistency.


The image presents us Python code. 


```python
n=str(x[i])[5]+str(x[i+1])[5]+str(x[i+2])[6]
```
