# Level 11 


An image named [cave](/11/cave.jpg) is given. 


The HTML title is `odd even`.


Other than the HTML title and the image name there isn't any more clues which means we'll probably have to solve the level solely using the image. 


```python
from PIL import Image

with Image.open("cave.jpg") as img:
    print(img.size)

# (640,480)
```


I first inspected the size of the image is which was `(640,480)`. Not really helpful though ...


Then I printed all the `rgb` values in the pixels using **[Image.getpixel](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.getpixel)**


```python
from PIL import Image

with Image.open("cave.jpg") as img:
    w, h = img.size
    for x in range(w):
        for y in range(h):
            pixels = img.getpixel((x, y))
            print(pixels)
```


It printed this. It just looks like a bunch of `rgb` values but, if you look closely you can see that all the pixels where the `x` coordinate is even always have the value 0 for the `b` pixel in rgb.  


Q Why is it even? when it's the first tuple? 


A The coordinates for **Image.getpixel** start from 0.

```
(3, 7, 0)
(147, 151, 100)
(4, 8, 0)
(133, 140, 89)
(3, 10, 0)
(131, 138, 87)
(6, 13, 0)
(129, 136, 85)
(3, 10, 0)
(131, 138, 87)
(1, 8, 0)
(133, 140, 89)
(1, 8, 0)
...
```


That's odd maybe I should check the image again. If you magnify the image it looks like **[this](/11/magnified.png)**. 


It pretty much looks like a checkerboard where 2 colors of squares(pixels) get repeated over and over again to make the image. 


I zoomed it on the image a bit more and **[this](/11/mangfied_again.png)**. 


Holy crap now it almost looks like a chess board. Black and White grids alternating.


Since all the pixels where the `x` values is even all have `0` for the `g` value in rgb. Separating the pixels where the `x` values are 0 with the pixels where the `x` values are will probably show something.


Imagine we had a grid pixel (4x4) like this. 


```
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) 
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) 
(0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) 
```


What we want to do is split the pixels like this. 


1\. Group pixels where the `x` value is even

(0,0)(2,0)
(0,1)(2,1)
(0,2)(2,2)
(0,3)(2,3)


2\. Group pixels where the `x` value is odd 


(1,0)(3,0)
(1,1)(3,1) 
(1,2)(3,2)
(1,3)(3,3) 


Now the `4x4` grid has become a `4x2` grid. 


It may sound a bit confusing but basically we're just splitting the image vertically and all the pixels from the even-number columns are grouped in the `even` image and all the pixels from the odd-number columns are grouped for the `odd` image. 


**[Image.new](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.new)** let's you create a new image. You need to pass the `mode` and the `size` the size needs to be a **tuple**. 


**[Image.getpixel](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.getpixel)** returns the pixel value at a certain coordinate. 


**[Image.putpixel](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.putpixel)** modify the pixel value at a certain coordinate. 


 
```python
from PIL import Image

with Image.open("cave.jpg") as img:
    odd = Image.new("RGB", (560, 560))
    even = Image.new("RGB", (560, 560))
    w, h = img.size
    for x in range(w):
        for y in range(h):
            pixel = img.getpixel((x, y))
            if x % 2 == 1:
                odd.putpixel((x // 2, y // 2), pixel)
            else:
                even.putpixel((x // 2, y // 2), pixel)

odd.show()
even.show()
odd.show()
even.show()
```

I get 2 files [odd.png](/11/odd.png) and **[this](/11/even.png)**. 


The first file has the word `evil` written vaguely on it. 


When changing the URL from http://www.huge:file@pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/5808.html to http://www.huge:file@pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/evil.html takes you to level 12.


I personally thought this level was hard. I'm still not sure if I understand the whole process 100% well. If I'm writing any wrong information please let me know so I can fix it.
