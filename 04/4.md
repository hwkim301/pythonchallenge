# Level 4

This time there isn't a HTML title nor an image but it says linkedlist.php. 

Changing the URL from http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.html to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php 
takes us to a level with an image like the previous levels. 


The title of the HTML is `follow the chain` and there's an image named [chainsaw](4/chainsaw.jpg). 


In the page source there's also an HTML comment that looks like this `<!-- urllib may help. DON'T TRY ALL NOTHINGS, since it will never end. 400 times is more than enough. -->`


There's also an link to it `<a href="linkedlist.php?nothing=12345">` as well. 

When clicking the weird image a nothing value set to `12345` via an HTTP GET request.


It says the next nothing is `44827` so I change the value with my hands. 


It says the next nothing is `45439`. I tried changing the nothing value manually a couple times more to check if there's a certain pattern. 


When changing the next nothing to `45439` I get a new message. `Your hands are getting tired and the next nothing is 94485`


When changing the next nothing to `94485` it says the next nothing is `72198`.


At first I subtracted the previous next nothing from the current next nothing to see if there was a sequence or a pattern but then went down a rabbit hole. 


That let me to just get the next nothing value via GET request using the requests module 


My initial guess was that I probably had to change the next nothing value a couple hundred or thousand times and at a certain point there wouldn't be a 
next nothing and something else would pop up instead.


The HTML was always in this format ```and the next nothing is 44827```.


and the next nothing is `number` so after sending a request the last element in the response would be the number and if it wasn't a number that would probably mean 
there isn't any more next nothings. 


For someone who's not familiar with Requests think of it as a message the server sends client. 

You usually use a `GET` request to view a web page and `POST` request to send data to a web page. 


Another distinctive point is that `GET` request commonly has a `?` in the URL. 
You usually pass parameters with `?` to send a specific query to the web page .


In our case we passed next nothings with `?`.


I set my nothing value to `0` because if you start with `12345` when the next nothing is `16044` the code will stop and give you `Yes. Divide by two and keep going.
I'm guessing `0` is the number after `16044` so you don't need to divide `16044` by `2`. 
Or you can just write `if` and `elif` statement to handle when the next nothing is `16044` dividing it by `2` 


`4.py` handles the `16044` division by with an `if`, `elif` statement  `4-1.py` starts with `0`


Both give you `peak.html`.


Changing the URL form http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/linkedlist.php to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/peak.html takes you to level5.
