# What is Python Challenge ?
Python challenge is a set of puzzles that can be solved by using Python.  
Currently there are 33 levels. 
IMHO Python Challenge is not for beginners who have never coded in Python before or have little experience in Python. 

It's for people who have some experience in Python but just aren't super good. 
So if it's your first time writting in Python code I wouldn't try to solve these problems.
Reading O'reilly books or learning from online courses would help you more. 

For courses I recommend [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAcTmDO6NTI&list=PLUl4u3cNGP62A-ynp6v6-LGBCzeH3VAQB) from MIT OCW.

The course explains Python in a pretty detailed manner for beginnners. 
The Professor used [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Programming-Learn-code-Python/dp/1617293784) for her lecture's in 2016. Not sure which textbook she's using in 2022 btw. 


## Solving level0 

The title for level0 is warming up 
You can check the [title](/images/warming_up.png) by looking at the tab where you opened the pythonchallenge problem.
From the title I can guess that this level shouldn't be that hard.

Level0 has a [picture](/images/0.png) of a old computer.
On the moniter there is a yellow rectangle with `2**38` written on it. 
Below the image of the computer there is a hint that tells you to change the URL address. 
With all the information it looks like I should use `2**38` and change the URL.

[This] (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html) is our current URL.
If you look closely there is a number in the URL 0.html. 
Calculating `2**38` and replacing it with 0 is likely to solve level0. 

Python has many ways to calculate `2**38`

1. Using the ** operator 
You can directly use ** to calcuate powers of numbers. 

```python
print(2**38)
```
would give you the answer 

2. Using the bit shift operator 
Python provides bit shifting operators.
That would be another option.

```python
print(2<<37)
```

3. Using the pow() 
Python provides the built-in [pow](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#pow) to calculate 
powers of nubmers. The pow function also let's you calculate the modular as well. 

```python 
print(pow(2,38))
```

Calculating `2**38` gives me 274877906944. 
When I change the URL from (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html) to (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/274877906944.html) changes the url and level1 pops up.
