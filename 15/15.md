# Level 15 

A an image of calendar file named **[screen15](/15/screen15.jpg)** is given. 


A circle is on the `26'th` of January and it looks like  the hundredth and the tenth year is gone so only know that the year is `1**6`.


The title of the HTML is `whom`.


The title implies we need to find a person that's born on that date `January 26th 1**6`.


The page source has some hints in HTML comment. 


```html 
<!-- he ain't the youngest, he is the second -->
```


There's also an HTML comment that looks like this. 


```html
<!-- todo: buy flowers for tomorrow -->
```


I wonder how the second HTML comment is going to be used to solve the level. Or will the second hint even be used at all? I'm not sure.


Anyways I need to check from 1006 to 1996 to check which years had `26th` as a monday.


Python provides a built-in **[datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)** module that helps you deal with dates. 


To check a certain date you can use the **[date](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date)** object the datetime module provides. 


By using **[date.weekday](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday)** you can check if  `January 26th` is a monday or not.


I wrote code like this. 

```python 
from datetime import date
for year in range(1006,2006,10):
    if (date(year,1,26).weekday()==0):
        print(year)
```


**date.weekday** will return `0` if it's monday and `1` if it's tuesday ... etc 


The years from `1006` to `1996` that had `January 26th` as a monday are the years below. 


```python 
1046
1176
1226
1356
1446
1576
1626
1756
1846
1976
```


The year we want is `1846`, then I searched google for famous people born on `1846 January 26th ` but couldn't find anyone that seemed to be the answer. 


Hmm, It looks like I'm missing something. I'm probably not using one of the hints python-challenge gave me. 


Let's go back to the image of a calendar. You can see there are the calendars for the next 2 months which are January and February.


If you take a close look at the calendar for **[february](/15/february.png)** it has a 29th.


If february has a 29th is a leap year. so we need to add a condition to check if the year is a leap year to our previous condition which checks if January 26th is a monday.


Python provides a built-in module called **[calendar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html)** for outputting calendars like the *nix `cal` command does.


Lucky for us it also provides a **[isleap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html)** function to check if a certain is year a leap year or not. 


Here's the updated code.


```python
from datetime import date
from calendar import isleap
for year in range(1006,2006,10):
    if (isleap(year) and date(year,1,26).weekday() == 0):
        print(year)
```


The output of the code looks like below. Our previous answer `1876` has been eliminated lol.

```python
1176
1356
1576
1756
1976
```

The final answer seems to be finding the name of a person born on `January 26th 1756`.


When googling it says mozart's official birthday is January 27th. According to **[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart)** Mozart was born on the 26th but was baptised a day after his birth day. so it's plausible to say his birthday is `January 26th 1756`.


Changing the URL from http://www.huge:file@pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/uzi.html to http://www.huge:file@pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/mozart.html takes you to level 16.
