# Level 6
<br>
This time a picture of [clothes with a zipper](/6/channel.jpg) is given. 

<br> 
The HTML title is `now there are pairs`. 

<br>
The image is named `channel.jpg`

<br>

There is an HTML comment in the page source `<!-- <-- zip -->` .
<br>

Probably has something to do with `zip`.

<br>
There weren't any more helpful hints. so I thought of changing the url from http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/channel.html
<br>

to http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/channel.zip as the hint told me to do. 

<br>
Surprisingly it lets you download a zip file named `channel.zip`. 
<br>

Running `file` command on `channel.zip` gives me this. 

``` bash 
file channel.zip 
channel.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate
```


```bash 
unzip channel.zip
```

Unzipping the zip file gave me a lot of text files. 
<br>

What I found out after unzipping the `channel.zip` was that all the text files started with a number as in `29.txt` and the number increased and that there was a `readme.txt`
<br>

```bash 
cat readme.txt 
```
<br>

The readme.txt had this written in it. 

```
welcome to my zipped list.

hint1: start from 90052
hint2: answer is inside the zip
```

<br>

So I went tried what was written in `90052.txt` as the readme.txt said before. 


```bash
cat 90052.txt
``` 


```
Next nothing is 94191
```

Tried it once more. 


```
cat 94191.txt 
Next nothing is 85503
```


I got tired of checking the next txt file so I decided to automate which file I had to read.


```python
number = 90052
while True:
    with open(f"{number}.txt", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    print(content)
    number = content.split()[-1]
    print(number)
    if "Next nothing is " not in content:
        break
```

I started from `90052.txt` that read the next file until I read all the files. 
<br>

The code is really similar to the code in level 4.
<br>

At the end this popped up. 

```
Collect the comments.
comments.
```
<br>
What should I do to collect comments? Does zipfiles have comments hidden?
<br>

Python has a module name [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.comment) to handle zip files.
<br>
In the zipfile module there is a [zipfile.comment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.comment) it shows the comments in a zipfile.
