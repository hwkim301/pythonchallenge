# Level25 

**[lake1.jpg](/25/lake1.jpg)** a picture of a lake is given.


The html title is `imagine how they sound`.


There's a comment in the page-source. 


```html
<!-- can you see the waves? -->
```

What exactly odes it mean I can see the waves.


The name of the image file python challenge gave us is named `lake1.jpg`. 


Let's check if there's an `lake2.jpg`. There isn't. 


There's gotta be some more files other than `lake1.jpg`, we already went to searching for extra files if the file name ended with a number in level12.


Let's try searching the parent directory I'm 100% sure there are other files. Let's move a directory [up](http://www.butter:fly@pythonchallenge.com/pc/hex/).


Okay I see a whole bunch of `wav` files. `25` wav files to be exact from `lake1.wav` to `lake25.wav`.


Let's save the wav files.


```python
import requests

for i in range(1,26):
    res=requests.get(f"http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/hex/lake{i}.wav",auth=("butter","fly"))
    with open(f"lake{i}.wav","wb") as f:
        f.write(res.content)
```


The wav files just make a beeping nose. Nothing interesting in the audio files itself.


After downloading the wav files I was stuck again. 


Then I read some hints online to check out the HTML comment in the page source `can you see the waves?`.


Since wav files are binary data and images are also binary data, I thought of saving the contents of a wav file to an image file.


I think that's exactly what python challenge wants me to do because if you look at [lake1.jpg](/25/lake1.jpg) closely it's divided into a 5x5 puzzle. 


Coincidentally we have 25 wav files. Which implies we should save each wav file to an image file like `lake1.jpg`.


Now you get the same [lake1.jpg](/25/lake1.jpg) with the word **decent** in blue in **[level25.png](/25/level25.png)**.


Changing the url to http://www.butter:fly@pythonchallenge.com/pc/hex/decent.html takes you to level26.
