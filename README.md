My personal solutions to the Python Challenge problems. 


Inspired by [hackingnote](https://www.hackingnote.com/en/python-challenge-solutions/) and [david.webook](https://david.webook.club/tag/the-python-challenge/)


Even though hackingnote's codes are a bit old, those people wrote nice pythonic code. 


I am going to write the explanations as detailed as possible and will try to show multiple ways to solve each level. 


Currently I'm using wsl2 to write the solutions for the challenges, therefore sometimes I will use solve the levels using *nix instead of Python. 


Hope this helps people that are stuck on pythonchallenge.
